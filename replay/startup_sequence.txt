◐ The user is asking me to run the session startup script for LLMCJF. This is a straightforward request to execute a shell script. I should run it and see what it does.

  Let me execute the script directly.

● Run LLMCJF session startup script
  $ bash llmcjf/session-start.sh
  └ 148 lines...

● The LLMCJF governance framework has been activated. The script is pausing for acknowledgment. I'll press Enter to continue.
