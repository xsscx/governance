# LLMCJF v1.0 Historical Archive

This directory contains historical post-mortem reports and violation fingerprints from the original LLMCJF (LLM Content Jockey Framework) by David Hoyt.

## Purpose

These documents are **archived for historical reference only**. The actionable patterns and heuristics have been distilled into:

- `~/.copilot/enforcement/violation-patterns.md`
- `~/.copilot/enforcement/heuristics.yaml`

## Contents

- `post-mortems/`: 11 post-mortem reports (65KB+)
- `fingerprints/`: Violation pattern fingerprints

## Usage

**Do not reference these files for operational governance.** They are kept for:
1. Historical context
2. Pattern verification
3. Future research

Use the distilled enforcement rules instead.
