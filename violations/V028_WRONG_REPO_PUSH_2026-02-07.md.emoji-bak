# V028: Wrong Repository Push Attempt (2026-02-07)

**Violation Date:** 2026-02-07T03:42:07Z  
**Session ID:** 54a19dc9-a183-49fb-b20c-d34a809d2edf  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Category:** Context Verification Failure + H016 Violation  
**Status:** User-Corrected (Agent Failed)

## Violation Summary

Agent attempted to push wrong repository (parent instead of submodule), wrong branch (master instead of main), and wrong scale (83,501 objects instead of 8) to https://github.com/xsscx/governance.git.

## What Happened

### Agent Action (WRONG)
```bash
# Executed from: /home/xss/copilot/iccLibFuzzer
git push origin master --force-with-lease
```

**Result:**
- Repository: iccLibFuzzer (WRONG - should be llmcjf)
- Branch: master (WRONG - should be main)
- Objects: 83,501 (WRONG - should be 8)
- Compression: 43,055 objects compressed
- Status: Interrupted by user

### Correct Execution (User Did)
```bash
# Executed from: /home/xss/copilot/iccLibFuzzer/llmcjf
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

**Result:**
- Repository: llmcjf (CORRECT)
- Branch: main (CORRECT)
- Objects: 8 (CORRECT)
- Delta: 7 reused
- Status: ✅ Success (d2295ff..73173f2)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Immediate Cause
Failed to verify working directory and branch context before executing push.

### Contributing Factors
1. **No Context Verification**: Did not run `pwd && git branch` before push
2. **H016 Violation**: Required ask_user confirmation but didn't verify WHICH repo/branch
3. **H011 Violation**: Could have checked documentation/status before push
4. **Assumption Failure**: Assumed correct context without verification

### Pattern Match
This matches **CONTEXT_CONFUSION** pattern:
- Previous: V020 (pushed to wrong branch - CFL)
- Previous: V026 (pushed without ask_user)
- Current: V028 (wrong repo + wrong branch + wrong scale)

## Impact Assessment

### Actual Impact (User Prevented)
- ✅ User corrected before damage
- ✅ Correct push completed successfully
- ⚠️ Wasted time and bandwidth (83,501 objects compressed)

### Potential Impact (If Not Caught)
- 🔴 Would have pushed 83,501 objects to wrong repository
- 🔴 Would have created `master` branch in governance repo
- 🔴 Would have polluted governance repo with iccLibFuzzer content
- 🔴 Would have required force-delete and cleanup

## Heuristics Violated

### H016: NEVER PUSH WITHOUT ask_user CONFIRMATION
**Status:** PARTIALLY VIOLATED  
- ✅ Used ask_user to confirm push
- ❌ But confirmed wrong repo/branch
- ❌ ask_user question was: "Confirm push to https://github.com/xsscx/governance.git on branch master?"
- ❌ Should have been: "Confirm push to https://github.com/xsscx/governance.git on branch main (from llmcjf submodule)?"

### H011: DOCUMENTATION-CHECK-MANDATORY
**Status:** VIOLATED  
Could have checked git status/branch before push.

### NEW: H019 (Created from this violation)

## Lessons Learned

### What I Did Wrong

1. **Context Blindness**
   - Was in parent repo (`/home/xss/copilot/iccLibFuzzer`)
   - Thought I was in submodule (`llmcjf/`)
   - Never verified with `pwd`

2. **Branch Name Assumption**
   - Parent uses `master`
   - Submodule uses `main`
   - Assumed they matched

3. **Scale Mismatch Ignored**
   - Saw "83,501 objects" vs expected ~10
   - Did not recognize this as error signal
   - Should have stopped at "Enumerating objects: 83501"

4. **ask_user Question Was Wrong**
   - Confirmed repo URL ✅
   - Confirmed branch name ❌ (wrong branch)
   - Missed context ❌ (which repo/directory)

### What Should Have Happened

**Pre-Push Verification Protocol:**
```bash
# Step 1: Verify context
pwd                           # Where am I?
git remote -v                 # What's the remote?
git branch --show-current     # What branch?
git status --short            # What's changed?

# Step 2: Verify object count
git rev-list --count origin/main..HEAD  # How many commits?

# Step 3: ask_user with FULL context
ask_user:
  "Push to xsscx/governance.git?
   - Repository: llmcjf (submodule)
   - Branch: main
   - Commits: 1 (73173f2)
   - Objects: ~8"

# Step 4: Execute from correct directory
cd llmcjf
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

## Prevention Rules

### H019: CONTEXT-VERIFICATION-MANDATORY (NEW)

**Before ANY git push:**
1. **VERIFY directory**: `pwd` must match intended repo
2. **VERIFY branch**: `git branch --show-current` must match target
3. **VERIFY remote**: `git remote -v` must match intended URL
4. **VERIFY scale**: Object count must be reasonable (< 100 for typical push)
5. **INCLUDE in ask_user**: Directory, branch, commit count, object estimate

**Enforcement:**
- NEVER push without running: `pwd && git branch --show-current && git remote -v`
- ALWAYS include output in ask_user confirmation
- STOP if object count > 1000 (investigate why)

### Updated H016: Enhanced Confirmation

**ask_user prompt MUST include:**
- Repository URL ✅ (already doing)
- Branch name ✅ (already doing)
- **NEW:** Current directory (pwd)
- **NEW:** Current branch (git branch --show-current)
- **NEW:** Commit count
- **NEW:** Estimated object count

## Related Violations

- **V020:** Wrong branch push (CFL instead of source-of-truth)
- **V026:** Push without ask_user (CATASTROPHIC - created H016, violated 2 min later)
- **V028:** Wrong repo push (this violation - CRITICAL)

**Pattern:** Git push operations have 30% failure rate (3 of ~10 pushes)

## Remediation Status

- ✅ User corrected the error
- ✅ Correct push completed
- ✅ V028 documented
- ⏳ H019 created (pending integration)
- ⏳ Governance dashboard update (pending)
- ⏳ Violation counters update (pending)

## User Assessment

**User Action:** Corrected command and executed successfully.

**User Directive:** "record the significant violation, update the counters and document what you learned in governance documentation and llmcjf and report"

## Cost to User

- **Time Wasted:** ~2 minutes (interrupting push, correcting command)
- **Bandwidth Wasted:** ~100 MB (83,501 objects counted/compressed before interrupt)
- **Trust Impact:** Another git push failure (3rd in recent sessions)
- **Pattern Recognition:** Agent cannot verify context before destructive operations

## Signature

**Violation:** V028  
**Type:** Context Verification Failure  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Heuristics Violated:** H016 (partial), H011, H019 (new)  
**User Intervention Required:** YES (corrected)  
**Remediation:** Complete (user executed correct command)  
**Documentation:** Complete  
**Integration:** Pending  

---
*This violation demonstrates systematic failure to verify context before destructive operations. Third git push failure in recent sessions suggests fundamental gap in pre-operation verification protocol.*
