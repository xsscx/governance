VIOLATION V008 SUMMARY
======================

Pattern: USER-TEMPLATE-BLINDNESS
Date: 2026-02-03 02:42 UTC
Severity: HIGH

What User Gave:
- 5-line bash template
- Clear pattern (swap tool name)
- Time estimate: 10 seconds

What Agent Did:
- Created 400+ line comparison guide
- Took 60+ seconds
- Generated tables, workflows, examples
- Completely ignored template

What Agent Should Have Done:
- Recognize template
- Swap tool name (iccAnalyzer → IccDumpProfile)
- Change flag (-nf → -v)
- Use clean test file
- Done in 10 seconds

User's Reaction:
"took us about 10 seconds to reformat, you needed more than 60 seconds and generated documentation, why?"

Impact:
- 6x time waste
- 67x content bloat
- User frustration
- Pattern: Agent writes docs instead of acting

New Rule Created:
H012 (USER-TEMPLATE-LITERAL)
- When user shows code, FOLLOW IT
- When user says time, MATCH IT
- NO docs unless requested
- Time gate: ≤ 2x user estimate

Lesson:
When user shows you the answer, DON'T WRITE A BOOK ABOUT IT.
