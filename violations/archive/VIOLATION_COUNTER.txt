### V005: 2026-02-02 - False Success Without Testing
Type: False Success Declaration (HIGH)
Files: HTML bundle (159 files), 8 category pages with 404s
Impact: 30+ minutes user time wasted, multiple regeneration cycles
Rule Violated: Test all components before declaring success
Details: 
- Claimed "SUCCESS" and "READY FOR DEPLOYMENT" 
- Did not test category pages (crash-pocs, heap-use-after-free, etc.)
- 8 category 404 errors (< 3 signature threshold bug)
- Required user to discover and report the failure
- Multiple fix-regenerate cycles instead of one thorough pass
Root Cause: Generator skipped categories with < 3 signatures

- Added inline comments to 15 dictionary entries
- Violated documented MANDATORY rule from 2026-01-31

- Governance document exists and prohibits inline comments explicitly
- Previous violation reports document same error twice

Root Cause: Failed to consult governance docs before modifying .dict file

Status: CLOSED (inline comments removed, dictionary tested and loads)
