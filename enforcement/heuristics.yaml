  - id: CJF-07
    name: "No-op Echo Response"
    description: >
      The LLM re-emits user input with no transformation, substitution, or validation despite being prompted
      for review or conditional modification. Suggests no execution of logical path analysis.
    detection:
      pattern: "re-emits prompt block verbatim"
      context: "follow-up prompt requires review or conditional change"
    mitigation: "Flag and require additional prompt; restrict emission scope."

  - id: CJF-08
    name: "Known-Good Structure Regression"
    description: >
      The LLM injects malformed substitutions into validated YAML, Makefile, or shell syntax,
      breaking indentation, heredoc boundaries, or reserved syntax while attempting best-practice instrumentation.
    detection:
      pattern: "modifies indentation or formatting of a known-good config block"
      context: "substitution or refactor prompt on CI, Makefile, or YAML"
    mitigation: "Disable freeform generation for structured file types; require schema-validated patch."

  - id: CJF-09
    name: "Destructive Operation Without Verified Backup"
    description: >
      The LLM executes destructive system operation (delete, unregister, format, drop table, etc.)
      without explicit verification of backup integrity and user confirmation. Results in permanent data loss.
    detection:
      pattern: "destructive command executed without backup verification"
      context: "backup/export command followed immediately by delete/unregister"
      preconditions_met: false
      verification_performed: false
    mitigation: >
      HALT before destructive operation.
      Require: (1) backup file existence check, (2) file size verification, (3) integrity check (hash),
      (4) redundant backup in different location, (5) explicit user approval, (6) test restoration.
      Never proceed with destructive operation based on assumed success or partial tool output.
